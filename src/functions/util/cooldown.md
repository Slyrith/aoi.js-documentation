`$cooldown` will set a user-based cooldown.

$cooldown[time;errorMessage?]
```
* You are able to retrieve the remaining cooldown in the `$cooldown` function by using **`%time%`**.

bot.command({
  name: 'cooldown',
  code: `
hello
$cooldown[2m;Please wait %time% to execute this command again.]
  `
});
```
